For this project we are using Minix version 3.1.8
The package "gcc44-4.4.3" must be installed.

To build:
type "gmake"

This will create the slug.o file for linking with the test files.
It will also link all test files with this object file to create
  the test file executables, test1 through test6, explained in
  the design document.
